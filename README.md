# About this repo:

This repo contains a solo project from Scrimba frontend career path module 3. It's a simple password generator, built from scratch in VS Code, implemented a figma design-pattern.

Additions and modifications I did:

- styling (mobile first)
- ability to copy
- ability to mask/unmask generated pw
- ability to set custom pw-length
- ability to choose between different charsets
- testfunction for automatic testing correct pw-length

Also did some bug-fixes (wrong length caused by not escaped characters). Still some errors left, but error-reate < 0,001%.
